Privilege Escalation

Privilege escalation occurs when an attacker gains higher-level permissions than intended.
This can involve moving from a low-privileged user to an administrator or accessing resources beyond authorization.

Privilege escalation often results from misconfigurations, weak permission controls, or authorization flaws.
