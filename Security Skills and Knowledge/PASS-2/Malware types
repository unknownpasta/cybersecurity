# Malware – Basics (PASS 2)

## Definition
Malware (malicious software) is software designed to perform unauthorized or harmful actions on a system, such as stealing data, maintaining unauthorized access, or disrupting normal operation.

---

## Common Malware Types

### Virus
A virus is malware that attaches itself to legitimate files or programs and executes when the infected file is run.

What it does:
- Modifies existing files
- Spreads through file execution
- Requires user interaction to spread

---

### Worm
A worm is self-propagating malware that spreads automatically across networks without user interaction.

What it does:
- Exploits network vulnerabilities
- Spreads rapidly between systems
- Consumes network and system resources

---

### Trojan
A trojan is malware disguised as legitimate software that users install willingly.

What it does:
- Provides unauthorized access
- Installs additional malware
- Often creates backdoors

---

### Ransomware
Ransomware encrypts files or systems and demands payment for restoration.

What it does:
- Encrypts user or system data
- Disrupts availability
- Often combined with data theft

---

### Spyware
Spyware secretly monitors user activity to collect information.

What it does:
- Steals credentials and personal data
- Tracks user behavior
- Operates stealthily in the background

---

### Backdoor
A backdoor is a hidden access mechanism that bypasses authentication controls.

What it does:
- Allows persistent unauthorized access
- Enables attackers to re-enter systems
- Often left behind after compromise

---

## Key Takeaway
Malware focuses on persistence, data access, and control rather than initial exploitation. Most malware succeeds due to misconfigurations, weak security controls, or user trust.
