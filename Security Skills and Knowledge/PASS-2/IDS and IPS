# IDS / IPS – Basics (PASS 2)

## Definition
IDS and IPS are security systems used to monitor network or system activity for malicious behavior.

- IDS detects suspicious activity and raises alerts.
- IPS detects suspicious activity and actively blocks or prevents it.

---

## IDS – Intrusion Detection System
An IDS monitors traffic or system activity and alerts when malicious behavior is detected.

What it does:
- Inspects network packets or logs
- Detects known attack patterns or anomalies
- Generates alerts for security teams

Key point:
- IDS does NOT block attacks
- It is used for visibility and detection

---

## IPS – Intrusion Prevention System
An IPS sits inline with traffic and can block malicious activity in real time.

What it does:
- Inspects traffic like IDS
- Automatically blocks or drops malicious packets
- Prevents attacks before they reach the target

Key point:
- IPS actively interferes with traffic
- Incorrect rules can block legitimate activity

---

## IDS vs IPS (Quick Comparison)

- IDS: Detects and alerts
- IPS: Detects and blocks
- IDS is passive
- IPS is active

---

## Detection Methods
IDS/IPS systems typically use:
- Signature-based detection (known attack patterns)
- Anomaly-based detection (unusual behavior)

Both methods can produce false positives and false negatives.

---

## Key Takeaway
IDS provides visibility into attacks, while IPS focuses on prevention. Both are used together to improve detection, response, and defense in depth.
