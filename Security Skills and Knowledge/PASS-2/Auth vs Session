Authentication vs Session vs Authorization

Authentication verifies a user's identity.
A session maintains that authenticated state using a session cookie.
Authorization determines what an authenticated session is allowed to do on each request.

Many vulnerabilities occur when authorization checks are missing or incorrect.
