Common Hacking Tools (Overview)

Security tools exist to answer specific questions, such as what services are exposed or how a web application handles input.
Examples include Nmap for port scanning, Burp Suite for inspecting HTTP requests, SQLmap for detecting SQL injection, and Wireshark for network traffic analysis.

Tools are used when a problem requires them, not memorized in advance.
