# Threat Hunting – Basics (PASS 2)

## Definition
Threat hunting is a proactive security practice focused on actively searching for hidden or unknown threats within systems and networks.

---

## Purpose
Threat hunting aims to:
- Identify attackers that bypassed detection systems
- Detect abnormal or suspicious behavior
- Reduce attacker dwell time
- Improve overall security posture

---

## How It Works
Threat hunting is hypothesis-driven and involves:
- Analyzing logs and system data
- Searching for unusual behavior
- Correlating events across multiple sources

---

## Difference from IDS/IPS
- IDS/IPS are reactive and alert-driven
- Threat hunting is proactive and does not rely on alerts

---

## Key Takeaway
Threat hunting assumes compromise and actively looks for evidence of attacker activity rather than waiting for automated alerts.
