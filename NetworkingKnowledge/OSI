'Open System Interconnection' or OSI when abbreviated
The OSI model is a conceptual framework that explains how data moves across networks using seven layers, helping different systems communicate and enabling easier troubleshooting.

THE SEVEN LAYERS
1) Physical layer
Transfers raw bits over a medium such as optic fibre cables, copper cables, radio waves through air.

2) Data link layer
Handles data transfer on a Local network using MAC (Media Access Control) and LLC (Logical Link Control), like WiFi or Ethernet.

3) Network Layer
Processes data on the larger scale via iP Addresses

4) Transport Layer
Uses ports to deliver data to the correct application, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
TCP is used when information is more valuable than time.
UDP is used when time is more valuable than information.

5) Session Layer
Manages and maintains communication sessions between systems.

6) Presentation Layer
Formats, Encrypts and compresses data to make sure its readable amd secure.
 
7) Application Layer
Provides Network services directly to user applications. eg HTTPS, SSH,  DNS.
