SSL/TLS Basics

TLS (Transport Layer Security) is used to encrypt communication between systems.
SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is the older version and is now deprecated.

TLS provides:
- Encryption (confidentiality)
- Authentication (identity verification)
- Integrity (prevents tampering)

HTTPS = HTTP over TLS (secure web traffic)
TLS conceptually belongs to the Presentation layer and runs over TCP.
